# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-THE-SELF-DRIVE-CAR-SYSTEM-WITH-HSV-INDICATORS-BASED-ON-RASPBERRY-PI-4-ARDUINO-NANO

In this study, we designed an autonomous drive system for a 1:10 scale RC car using the main components in the form of a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Raspberry Pi camera as image processing for automatic control of an self driving car. Then the Arduino Nano, BTS7960, and Driver L298N components are used to regulate the movement of the DC motor. In this article, the control strategy of this self-driving car will be shown which will be implemented to detect lanes as a guide to walk autonomously. This study uses the HSV color filer method with morphology techniques to detect the path to be passed. This study resulted in a path detection that was very accurate and operated in real-time when compared to the CNN method using sampling paths to be passed that had previously been researched. After the path is detected, the interconnection between the mini computer and the microcontroller will work to synchronize the path detection and motor movement. In trials and hardware implementations carried out in the self-driving car laboratory with artificial intelligence, it can work according to the algorithm created with a success rate of 90%
